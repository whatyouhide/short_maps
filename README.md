Implementation of a `~m` sigil for ES6-like maps in Elixir.

## Rationale

ShortMaps is the result of a
[discussion in the Elixir mailing list][google-groups]. The topic of the
discussion was the introduction of a syntax for maps similar to ES6 map syntax:

```elixir
foo = 1
bar = 2

%{foo, bar} == %{foo: foo, bar: bar}
#=> true
```

The discussion on pros and cons went on for a while until @josevalim came up
with a better solution (like he always does): using sigils.

```elixir
foo = 1
bar = 2

~m(foo bar)a == %{foo: foo, bar: bar}
#=> true
```

Sigils allow to:

- be more explicit and declarative
- use both atom and string keys (using modifiers in the sigil)

This library is an attempt to implement this so that you can try it out.

## Examples

Note that you always have to `import ShortMaps` for the sigil to work.

```elixir
import ShortMaps

my_map = %{foo: 1, bar: 2, baz: 3}

~m(foo bar baz)a = my_map
foo #=> 1
```

```elixir
import ShortMaps

name = "Meg"

# String keys by default (or with the 's' modifier)
~m(name) #=> %{"name" => "Meg"}
# Atom keys with the 'a' modifier
~m(name)a #=> %{name: "Meg"}
```

There is also support for pinning variables, if you want to do matching
vs. their previous value:

```elixir
iex(1)> import ShortMaps
nil
iex(2)> name = "Meg"
"Meg"
iex(3)> ~m(^name)a = %{name: "Meg"}
%{name: "Meg"}
iex(4)> ~m(^name)a = %{name: "Megan"}
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: %{name: "Megan"}
```

If you need to match on structs, the first word should be '%' followed by the
name of the module:

```elixir
iex(1)> import ShortMaps
nil
iex(2)> defmodule Foo do
...(2)>  defstruct bar: nil
...(2)>end
{:module, Foo,
 <<...>>,
 [bar: nil]}

iex(3)> ~m(%Foo bar)a = %Foo{bar: 5}
%Foo{bar: 5}
iex(4)> bar
5
iex(5)> ~m(%Foo ^bar)a = %Foo{bar: 12}
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: %Foo{bar: 12}
```

You can see more examples and read some docs in the docs for the `sigil_m`
macro.
